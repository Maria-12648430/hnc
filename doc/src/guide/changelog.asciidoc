== Changelog

=== 0.1.0

First release.

=== 0.2.0

Mostly refactoring, cleanup, and some new features.

* `give_away/3,4`: Designate another process as owner of a worker.

* Only the process owning a worker is allowed to check it in.

* Checking in and giving away from inside transactions is not possible
  any more.

* The API functions now work with worker identifiers instead of
  worker pids. To get the "real" worker, `hnc:get_worker/1` must
  be used to obtain the worker pid from the identifier.

* Added documentation for embedded mode and advanced usage.
